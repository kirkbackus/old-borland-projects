old-borland-projects
====================

Lots of my old programming projects made in the Borland C++ Builder 6 IDE

These were mainly created throughout my years in highschool.  In college I switched to using MinGW (for C++ windows apps) and GCC instead of Borland's compiler.  Many of these are just junk projects or proof of concept projects.
